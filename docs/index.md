### Bio	

Hi, I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.	

My interest is in the development of scalable planning and learning solutions for problems involving autonomous agents. I love to work with theoretical ideas applicable to broadly relevant problems.

### Experience

#### Full Stack Developer, Srimayi Innovations Pvt. Ltd.
   Working with the development team at Srimayi was my first professional experience. I worked on Android application development to design and implement new features to be deployed on Google Play Store. I also worked with the backend team to develop and integrate AWS services with the application. 
   
#### Research Fellow, Khoury College of Computer Sciences
   I had the opportunity to work with Lab for Learning and Planning in Robotics to assist a postdoctoral researcher to combine sample-based planning with deep unsupervised techniques with the objective to extend the Mutli-agent POMDP solution to continuous environments. I developed and ran experiments to integrate autoencoder and Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder with a cross-entropy based technique to model the density of the objective event in simulation.
   
#### Machine Learning Intern, LiveData Utilities
   I worked with the LiveData team as an intern to work on a translation problem, for which I framed the problem as a classification task and implemented the solution with POS tagging and deep learning.
   
#### Techincal Intern, Oracle
   After LiveData Utilities was acquired by Oracle, I continued to extend my previous at LiveData to integrate the ML solution into an ETL-based Batch Creation process working with Oracle SQL. My portfolio was diversified further with an opportunity to develop and test for a product in C/C++.
   
### Recent Projects	

- #### [Neural Code Summarization](https://github.com/shrivastava-piyush/nlp-code-summarization):	
   I used a Seq2Seq model with additive attention to generate code descriptors for segments of code in different languages such as Java, Python and C. 
   
   ![C Dataset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10284334/109447837-a15a9400-7a12-11eb-8389-c131d7c9cd61.png)
   A custom dataset for segments of C was generated with [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller) to evaluate the performance of models on a code-commit message pair. The objective is to better understand the history of a project.
   

- #### Deep-sample based planning:	
  During my research fellowship at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, I assisted a Postdoctoral researcher in implementing and evaluating a Multi-agent POMDP technique extended to continuous environments with a compressed representation and quantization.	

- #### Solving Sudoku:	

  A collaborative effort to recognize Sudoku characters based on a custom dataset generated from newspapers, framing and solving Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction problem.

- #### [Graphical representation of concepts](https://github.com/shrivastava-piyush/conceptual-mindmaps):
  I'm experimenting on the topic of meta-learning to find suitable non-linear approcahes to form an idea about theoretical concepts of computer science. 
  ![Decision Trees](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10284334/109446387-93574400-7a0f-11eb-80c1-a126830ad269.png)
  
  For instance, Decision Trees would be a particaular branch of machine learning algorithms. This allows the learner to construe the interactive relationship between different ideas related to a concept. This comes handy especially while revision, since notes written in a linear fashion fail to capture interdependence of many ideas, while this spectral representation allows a linkage between any two nodes.
