## Bio

I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University, with a specialization in AI.

My interest is in the development of scalable planning and learning solutions for problems involving autonomous agents. I love to work with theoretical ideas applicable to broadly relevant problems.

### Projects

#### Neural Code Summarization:
I used attention-based models to generate code descriptors for segments of code in different languages such as Java, Python and C.

#### Deep-sample based planning:
During my research fellowship at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, I assisted a Postdoctoral researcher in implementing and evaluating a Multi-agent POMDP technique extended to continuous environments with a compressed representation and quantization.

#### Solving Sudoku:
