## Bio	

I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University, with a specialization in AI.	

My interest is in the development of scalable planning and learning solutions for problems involving autonomous agents. I love to work with theoretical ideas applicable to broadly relevant problems.	

### Projects	

#### [Neural Code Summarization](https://github.com/shrivastava-piyush/nlp-code-summarization):	
I used attention-based models to generate code descriptors for segments of code in different languages such as Java, Python and C.	

#### Deep-sample based planning:	
During my research fellowship at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, I assisted a Postdoctoral researcher in implementing and evaluating a Multi-agent POMDP technique extended to continuous environments with a compressed representation and quantization.	

#### Solving Sudoku:	

A collaborative effort to recognize Sudoku characters based on a custom dataset generated from newspapers, framing and solving Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction problem.

#### [Graphical representation of concepts](https://github.com/shrivastava-piyush/conceptual-mindmaps):
I'm experimenting on the topic of meta-learning to find suitable non-linear approcahes to form an idea about theoretical concepts of computer science.

For instance, Decision Trees would be a particaular branch of machine learning algorithms.
